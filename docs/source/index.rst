==================================

**Phazap** is a package to efficiently post-process gravitational-wave (GW)
parameter estimation data to obtain the phases and polarization state of
the signal at a given detector and frequency. Details on the method
are presented in `Ezquiaga, Hu, Lo (2023) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06616>`_.
